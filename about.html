                 <p> At the Beauty Parlour, we believe in beauty with a conscience. 
                     We have created a salon that offers the highest quality hair services in a setting that
                      is healthier for the environment, our guests and our staff. The Beauty Parlour is designed 
                      and built primarily with recycled materials: the floor is made of reclaimed wood from a local
                       grain elevator – preserving and showcasing its natural texture – and most of the fixtures and 
                       furniture are refurbished or original vintage pieces.
                      We carry high quality professional hair products designed to ensure our guests look their best,
                       both in the salon and at home. The hair care products we carry have been carefully chosen based
                        both on performance and eco-sensitivity. As a clean air salon, we offer ammonia-free colour services
                         with little to no scent properties or chemical emanation. This healthier alternative to traditional
                          colouring practices is also safe for expectant mothers and individuals with allergies or scent sensitivities.
                      Our design and philosophy work hand in hand. </p>
